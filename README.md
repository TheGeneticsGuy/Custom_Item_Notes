***CUSTOM ITEM NOTES***

* Set an unlimited number of Notes to any item in-game. These notes will appear in your tooltip over the items.

Key Points:

* You must mouseover the item to add or remove notes.

* Your character limit is set to 255 per note. The added notes will wrap if sufficiently large.

* Each item has an UNLIMITED number of notes that can be set.

* I set the notes to be account wide. It seems like notes would be useful account wide rather than per toon, but let me know otherwise.


**SLASH COMMANDS**

*"|x" is representative of any number and is if you wish to insert/delete a note at a custom note position (|3 for Note3). Otherwise, it will add to the bottom, or delete from bottom first. The "|" bar must be used at end of slash command to specify.*

* /cin [Insert Custom Note Here]

* /cin add [Insert Custom Note Here] |x

* /cin edit [Insert New Note Here] |x

* /cin del |x

* /cin clearall

*Again, note, the |x position is optional and the default will just add or remove from the bottom.*
